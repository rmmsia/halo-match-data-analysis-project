# halo-match-data-analysis-project
My first data-driven project. Comments on how to optimise the code are welcome!

I wanted to give myself a challenge in using data to solve real-world problems, so I wondered to myself, "Where do I start"? Sure I could just search for beginner project ideas online, but that's boring. Often times I would be pointed in the direction of the usual suspects, like data.gov, World Bank, AWS or GCP, but I had the idea that these datasets are full of quantities and values that are a bore to look at. Not very engaging subject matter.

That's when I came up with the bright idea to ask my friend for his match data for the popular on the popular first-person shooter series Halo, more specifically the Master Chief Collection. I could very easily understand what was going on and what indicates a good or bad game. The goal is to draw some conclusions from his statistics so he can better understand which aspects of the game he is strongest at and which ones he needs to improve.

This is still very much a work in progress.
